# Affected version

xwn5001-0.4.1.1

# Vulnerability description

A buffer overflow exists in the NETGEAR xwn5001-0.4.1.1. As a result, an attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially remote code execution.

# Vulnerability location

The call to strcpy at address `0x43114C` in the function `sub_431070`. 

# Vulnerability Reproduction Steps

Environment :

Verification was conducted through simulation. The rehost environment is [xwn5001rehosted.tar.gz](../xwn5001rehosted.tar.gz). This is a simulation result based on [Greenhouse](https://github.com/sefcom/greenhouse).The operating system used for reproduction is Ubuntu 22 (other environments that can use docker-compose should also work).

Reproduction steps:

1. Navigate to the debug directory in the simulation environment and start the rehost environment using the commands `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up`.

2. Trigger the vulnerability by sending packages. I have attached the package sending script [send.py](../send.py) and data packages [package1.raw](package1.raw), [package2.raw](package2.raw),[package3.raw](package3.raw). The usage is `python3 send.py xxx`. If there are multiple data packages input, repeat this step to send multiple data packages.

For detailed reproduction instructions, please refer to my attached [video](DemonstrationProcess.mp4)

# Vulnerability Details

1. After sending the first data packet, since the value of `submit_flag` is `plc_qos_dev_port_config`, the program calls `sub_431514` via the `off_4718B0` function table in the `cgi_setobject` function. In `sub_431514`, the program calls fucntion `do_setting` and sets the value of `plc_qos_port_select` from the packet and saves it in variance `plc_qos_port_select` according to `off_473A70`.

2. After sending the second data packet, since the value of `submit_flag` is `plc_qos_port_edit`, the program calls `sub_431070` via the `off_4718B0` function table in the `cgi_setobject` function. In `sub_431070`, the program retrieves the value of the variable `plc_qos_port_select` and checks if it is not empty. After that, it extracts the value of `qos_port_priority` from the packet, ensuring it is not empty. Then, it extracts the value of `plc_qos_port` from the packet and writes it into the variable `v8`, causing a buffer overflow.
